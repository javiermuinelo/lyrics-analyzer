We were young with a dream and a midnight sky,
Dancing on rooftops, trying to touch the fireflies,
You whispered promises, like secrets in the dark,
Every heartbeat echoed like a wild, shooting star.

But seasons change, and so did we,
Like autumn leaves falling, oh can't you see?
But I'll hold the moments, even when they fade,
You were my anthem, a sweet serenade.

So I'm chasing starlight, running through the night,
With every step I take, I can feel your light.
Fingers intertwined, we were writing our story,
In a world of chaos, you were my glory.
Oh, I'm chasing starlight, through the twists and turns,
In the ashes of our love, it's you that forever burns.

We painted skies with laughter, wrote our names in the sand,
With every laugh and every tear, I was your biggest fan,
But time slipped like water, and we drifted apart,
Yet echoes of your laughter still linger in my heart.

But I'll keep the sparks, even if they fade,
In a sepia memory, where none are betrayed.
You were my symphony, a song so divine,
Even in the silence, our hearts still align.

So I'm chasing starlight, running through the night,
With every step I take, I can feel your light.
Fingers intertwined, we were writing our story,
In a world of chaos, you were my glory.
Oh, I'm chasing starlight, through the twists and turns,
In the ashes of our love, it's you that forever burns.

So here's to the nights when we danced in the rain,
Through every heartbreak, through every sweet pain,
You may be a whisper, but I'll never forget,
The way we wrote our destiny, a love without regret.

So I'm chasing starlight, running through the night,
With every step I take, I can feel your light.
Fingers intertwined, we were writing our story,
In a world of chaos, you were my glory.
Oh, I'm chasing starlight, through the twists and turns,
In the ashes of our love, it's you that forever burns.

So if you see me, looking up at the stars,
Just know I'm still dreaming, chasing you from afar.
In the galaxy of hearts, where love never dies,
I'll keep chasing starlight, till the end of time.
