Hi kids do you like violence Yeah yeah yeah
Wanna see me stick nineinch nails through each one of my eyelids Uhhuh
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did Yeah yeah
Try cid and get fucked up worse than my life is Huh
My brains dead weight Im tryna get my head straight
But I cant figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate Oh
And Dr Dre said Slim Shady you a basehead Uhuh
Then whys your face red Man you wasted
Well since age 12 I felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here slut Shady wait a minute thats my girl dawg
I dont give a fuck God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high Shh
Thanks a lot next semester Ill be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper Ow
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial running over pedestrians in a spaceship While theyre screaming at me Lets just be friends
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do Damn
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her
Oh thank you
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans
Ahh ahh ahh
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph Dude can I get your autograph
So I signed it Dear Dave thanks for the support asshole
Hi my name is huh My name is who
My name is chkachka Slim Shady

Stop the tape this kid needs to be locked away Get him

Im not ready to leave its too scary to die Fuck that
Ill have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Huh yup
Am I comin or goin I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka dare me to drive Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I aint had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide Whoops
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk Ill fuck anything that walks Come here
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me Mom You aint got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head Bang
Cause Im steamin mad Grr
And by the way when you see my dad Yeah
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
Hi my name is what My name is who
My name is chkachka Slim Shady

Hi my name is who My name is huh

Eminem,"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you will to be saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls Yeah their throwaway children
We seem to be approaching Cmon an age of the gross Burp
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station and eachand each generation should do a little bit better
All right come on lets cut the bullshit enough
Lets get it started lets start addressin this issue and open it up
Lets take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements thats made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin to destroy
Lets rewind it to 89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit crossin 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory Id like to share a story
This is my story and cant nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me I am wellaware
That I dont belong here youve made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From BelAire shopping center just for stoppin in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay theres a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it haulin my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks
So lets go back follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on lets go back follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Id roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes Id stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebodys backyard and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mamas on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when Im kicked out my moms
Thats about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn handin out some flyers
We was doin some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like Im out my mind
Shook his head like White boys dont know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line
So lets go back follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on lets go back follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
My first year in 9th grade cant forget that day at school
It was cool til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Pumas the brand cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors but man goddamn they flew
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J Ice Lamb suede too
But we just threw em in the trash like they yesterdays news
Guess who came through next X Clan debuted
Professor X Vanglorious
Exist in a state of red black and green with a key sissies
Now with this bein the new trend we dont fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we aint know what it meant me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With em all over our necks like were showin em off
Not knowin at all we was bein laughed at
You aint even half black
You aint posed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flav clock we gon have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin back at
Manixs basement sayin how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clans tape is
Which reminds me back in 89 me
And Kim broke up for the first time she was tryin to twotime me
And there was this black girl at our school who thought I was cool
Cause I rapped so she was kinda eyein me
And oh the irony guess what her name was
Aint even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the Ole Foolish Pride girl but Ive heard
People say they heard the tape and it aint that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize I was wrong
Cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a
So lets go back follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on lets go back follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Fuck out of my house you fuckin pieces of shit
Get the fuck out of my house you stupid fucker
You son of a bitch"
Eminem,"When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized she was the crazy one
But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change it
Cause thats just the way she was
They said I cant rap about bein broke no more
They aint say I cant rap about coke no more Ahh
Slut you think I wont choke no whore
Til them vocal cords dont work in her throat no more Ahh
These motherfuckers are thinkin Im playing
Thinkin Im sayin this shit cause Im thinkin it just to be sayin it Ahh
Put your hands down bitchI aint gon shoot you
Ima pull you to this bullet and put it through you Ahh
Shut up slut Youre causin too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slutokay Ma
Oh now hes rapin his own mother
Abusin a whore snortin coke
And we gave him the Rollin Stone cover
Youre goddamn right bitch and now its too late
Im triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin vrin vrin vrin
Texas Chainsaw left his brains all
Danglin from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood guts guns cuts
Knives lives wives nuns sluts
Bitch Ima kill you You dont wanna fuck with me
Girls neither you aint nothin but a slut to me
Bitch Ima kill you You aint got the balls to beef
We aint gon never stop beefin I dont squash the beef
You better kill me Ima be another rapper dead
For poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldnt have said
But when they kill me Im bringin the world with me
Bitches too you aint nothin but a girl to me
I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady Cause why
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you Ah haha
I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady Why
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you
Bitch Ima kill you Like a murder weapon Ima conceal you
In a closet with mildew sheets pillows and film you
Fuck with me I been through Hell shut the hell up
Im tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell em
I aint acid rap but I rap on acid
Got a new blowup doll and just had a strapon added
Whoops Is that a subliminal hint
No just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend No Eminemll insult
And if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
To do it again then if he does it again
Youll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the tenth
Bitch Ima kill you I aint done this aint the chorus
I aint even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub but thats normal aint it Norman
Serial killer hidin murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again were out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours let us in
Or Ima kill you You dont wanna fuck with me
Girls neither you aint nothin but a slut to me
Bitch Ima kill you You aint got the balls to beef
We aint gon never stop beefin I dont squash the beef
You better kill me Ima be another rapper dead
For poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldnt have said
But when they kill me Im bringin the world with me
Bitches too you aint nothin but a girl to me
I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady Cause why
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you Ah haha
I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady Why
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you
Know why I say these things
Cause ladies screams keep creepin in Shadys dreams
And the way things seem I shouldnt have to pay these shrinks
These 80 Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice whatever I hate these things
Fuck shots I hope the weedll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with em cause their ratings stink
Fuck that Ill choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From inschool to before school to outta school
I dont even believe in breathing
Im leavin air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it
Okay Im ready to go play I got the machete from O J
Im ready to make everyones throats ache
You faggots keep eggin me on
Til I have you at knifepoint then you beg me to stop
Shut up Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when Im talkin to you
You hear me Answer me
Or Ima kill you You dont wanna fuck with me
Girls neither you aint nothin but a slut to me
Bitch Ima kill you You dont got the balls to beef
We aint gon never stop beefin I dont squash the beef
You better kill me Ima be another rapper dead
For poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldnt have said
But when they kill me Im bringin the world with me
Bitches too you aint nothin but a girl to me
Bitch Ima kill you
You dont wanna fuck with Shady Cause why
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you Ah haha
I said you dont wanna fuck with Shady Why not
Cause Shady will fuckin kill you
Hahaha Im just playin ladies

Eminem,"Okay Im going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check onetwo we recordin
Im cancerous so when I diss you wouldnt wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
Ill strangle you to death then Ill choke you again
And break your fuckin legs til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me Ima even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
Oh no So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet Bitch
My nerves hurt and lately Im on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out Cmere his blond dreads Fuck you
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed take pills drop out of school kill people
And drink jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
Im dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So Im dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that Im white ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I dont get pissed yall dont even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white I dont even exist
I get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger wont go down how do I wave
And this is how Im supposed to teach kids how to behave
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then OD
Now dont you want to grow up to be just like me
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door mustve been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
Killed them both then smeared blood on the white Bronco
We did it My mind wont work if my spine dont jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
Im not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
Thatll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap styles warped Im runnin out the morgue
With your dead grandmothers corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
Im bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel That shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and Im in pain
I take a breather and sigh either Im high or Im nuts
Cause if you aint tiltin this room neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit its over with
I bought Cages tape opened it and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
Ive been with ten women who got HIV
Now dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Dont you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me"
Eminem,"Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how Everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over blaow
Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope
There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms
Close to postmortem it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter he blows its all over
These hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads
God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no more hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
No more games Ima change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nineto
Five and I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its gettin even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotonys
Gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got
To go I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to man"
Bob Dylan,"Johnnys in the basement mixin up the medicine
Im on the pavement thinkin about the government
The man in a trench coat badge out laid off
Says hes got a bad cough wants to get it paid off
Look out kid its somethin you did
God knows when but youre doin it again
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills  you only got 10
Maggie comes fleet foot face full of black soot
Talkin that the heat put plants in the bed but
Phones tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the DA
Look out kid dont matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes dont tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose watch the plainclothes
You dont need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Oh get sick get well hang around a ink well
Hang bail hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard get barred get back ride rail
Get jailed jump bail join the Army if you fail
Look out kid youre gonna get hit
By losers cheaters sixtime users
Hanging round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpools looking for a new fool
Dont follow leaders awatch the parking meters
Oh get born keep warm
Short pants romance
Learn to dance get dressed
Get blessed try to be a success
Please her please him buy gifts
Dont steal dont lift
20 years of schoolin and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole light yourself a candle
Dont wear sandals try to avoid the scandals
Dont want to be a bum you better chew gum
The pump dont work cause the vandals took the handles"
Bob Dylan,"Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
Ill always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steeleyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where its always safe and warm
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
Now theres a wall between us
Something theres been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
Well the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
Its doom alone that counts
And the oneeyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
Ive heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm
Well Im living in a foreign country
But Im bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razors edge
Someday Ill make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
Come in she said Ill give ya
Shelter from the storm"
Bob Dylan,"Well I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
Come along and take a trip
Well bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids
Yippee
Well I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didnt come close to a mountain
And I hate bears
Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
Oh well I said its a pretty big ship
Besides anyhow the more the merrier
Well we all got on and what do you think
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept apiling on
That old ship was agoing down
Funny way to start a picnic
Well I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs abarking cats ascreaming
Women ayelling men aflying fists aflying
Paper flying cops acoming me arunning
Maybe we just better call off the picnic
I got shoved down got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin sound
Dont remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldnt walk
I couldnt talk smell feel
Couldnt see
Didnt know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though
Well feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing Id never got up that mornin
Now I dont care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic thats up to you
But dont tell me about it I dont want to hear it
You see I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom
Well it dont seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
Theres a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebodys money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic"
Bob Dylan,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime didnt you
People call say Beware doll youre bound to fall
You thought they were all akiddin you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin out
Now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aw youve gone to the finest school all right Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobodys ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now youre gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
Hes not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say Do you want to make a deal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aw you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it aint no good
You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Aint it hard when you discover that
He really wasnt where its at
After he took from you everything he could steal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aw princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Theyre all drinkin thinkin that they got it made
Exchangin all precious gifts
But youd better take your diamond ring ya better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls ya ya cant refuse
When ya aint got nothin you got nothin to lose
Youre invisible now ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
Aw how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone"
Bob Dylan,"May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young forever young
May you stay forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young forever young
May you stay forever young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young forever young
May you stay forever young"
Kanye West,"Last October Grammynominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident His jaw was fractured in nearly three places Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut so the world could feel his pain
Yo Gee they cant stop me from rappin can they
Can they Hop
Through the fire to the limit to the wall
For a chance to be with you Id gladly risk it all
Through the fire through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you Id take it all the way
Right down to the wire even through the fire
I spit it through the wire man
Theres too much stuff on my heart right now man
Id gladly risk it all right now
Its a lifeordeath situation man
Yall yall dont really understand how I feel right now man
Its your boy Kanye to the
ChiTown whats goin on
Uhhuh yeah yeah

Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been tryna be mine
She a Delta so shed been throwin that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin I been tryna be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint tryna make a band
I swear this right here history in the makin man
Through the fire to the limit to the wall
For a chance to be with you Id gladly risk it all
Through the fire through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you Id take it all the way
Right down to the wire even through the fire
I really apologize for everything right now
If its unclear at all man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like I dunno the doctor said like six weeks
Yknow he had I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man
I couldnt believe it
But Im still here for yall right now man
This what I got to say right here dawg
Yeah turn me up yeah uh
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around
But he wasnt talkin bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word cept hes really puttin it down
And he explained the story bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt Mason Betha
Thank God I aint too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe safe
My dawgs couldnt tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky it was televised
Theres been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable what you thought theyd call me Mr Glass
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up Im a grownass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But Im a champion so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music thats fire spit my soul through the wire
Through the fire to the limit to the wall
For a chance to be with you Id gladly risk it all
Through the fire through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you Id take it all the way
Right down to the wire even through the fire
Yknow what Im sayin
When the doctor told me I had um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said Dawg dont you realize Ill never make it on a plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on
You cant be serious man"
Kanye West,"Stadium status
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout
Picture us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
That he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why dont you wave your hands
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why dont you wave your hands
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack Citygot to keep my brother
But to be number one Ima beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate español No way José
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
My big brother was BIGs brother
So heres a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell em
A idol in my eyes god of the game
Heart of the City RocaFella chain
Never be the same never be another
Number one Young Hov also my big brother
My big brother was BIGs brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor and thats where the story ends
Toomp killed this shit"
Kanye West,"Oh yeah
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people thats
Drug dealin just to get by
Stack your money til it get sky high
We wasnt sposed to make it past twentyfive
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
We dont care what people say
If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold man
We never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
Took nothin from no man man Im my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flicking Starter coats manman you dont know man
We dont care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they aint finna say Next summer Im finna
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do something man your ass is grown
Drug dealin just to get by
Stack your money til it get sky high
Kids sing Kids sing
We wasnt sposed to make it past twentyfive
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
We dont care what people say
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off 655
And everybody selling makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job
So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say my niggas
Drug dealin just to get by Yeah
Stack your money til it get sky high
Kids sing Kids sing
We wasnt sposed to make it past twentyfive
Jokes on you we still alive Alive uhhuh
Throw your hands up in the sky and say

You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song 12 Questions
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my mama I belong in that slow class
Its bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say my niggas
Drug dealin just to get by
Stack your money til it get sky high
Kids sing Kids sing
We wasnt sposed to make it past twentyfive
Jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say

Kanye West,"In the night I hear em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh how could you be so heartless
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
In the night I hear em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh how could you be so heartless
How could you be so Dr Evil
Youre bringin out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gon speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me fo
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gon see
Youll never find nobody better than me
In the night I hear em talk Me
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh how could you be so heartless
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby lets just knock it off
They dont know what we been through
They dont know bout me and you
So I got somethin new to see
And you just gon keep hatin me
And we just gon be enemies
I know you cant believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you cant make it right
Im gon take off tonight into the night
In the night I hear em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless How how
Oh how could you be so heartless
On and on and on and on
And on and and on and on and on"
Queen,"Is this the real life Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see
Im just a poor boy I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come easy go little high little low
Any way the wind blows doesnt really matter to me to me
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now hes dead
Mama life had just begun
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh didnt mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine bodys aching all the time
Goodbye everybody Ive got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh Any way the wind blows
I dont wanna die
I sometimes wish Id never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Figaro magnifico
But Im just a poor boy nobody loves me
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah No we will not let you go
Let him go Bismillah We will not let you go
Let him go Bismillah We will not let you go
Let me go Will not let you go
Let me go Will not let you go
Never never never never let me go Ah
No no no no no no no
Oh mamma mia mamma mia Mamma mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby cant do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh yeah ooh yeah
Nothing really matters anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows"
Queen,"Buddy youre a boy make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can
All over the place singing
We will we will rock you
We will we will rock you
Buddy youre a young man hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner
All over the place

Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back
Into your place
We will we will rock you sing it
We will we will rock you everybody
We will we will rock you hmm
We will we will rock you alright"
Queen,"Empty spaces what are we living for
Abandoned places I guess we know the score on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for
Another hero another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens Ill leave it all to chance
Another heartache another failed romance on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for
I guess Im learning
I must be warmer now
Ill soon be turning round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark Im aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday grow but never die
I can fly my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
Ill face it with a grin
Im never giving in
On with the show
Ill top the bill
Ill overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on"
Queen,"Ive paid my dues
Time after time
Ive done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
Ive made a few
Ive had my share of sand kicked in my face
But Ive come through
And I need to go on and on and on and on
We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions
Of the world
Ive taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But its been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I aint gonna lose
And I need to go on and on and on and on
We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions
Of the world
We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting til the end oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions"
Queen,"Ooh lets go
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Aint no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready Hey are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think Im going to get along
Without you when youre gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Hey
Oh take it
Bite the dust hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust ow
Another one bites the dust hey hey
Another one bites the dust heyeheh
Ooh
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him you can cheat him you can treat him bad
And leave him when hes down yeah
But Im ready yes Im ready for you
Im standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out

The Beatles,"When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide

The Beatles,"I read the news todayoh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didnt notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
Theyd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
Id love to turn you on
Seven Eight Nine Ten
alarm clock rings
Woke up fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahhahahah
Ahahah ahahahh
I read the news todayoh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
Id love to turn you on

studio chatter"
The Beatles,"You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college money spent
See no future pay no rent
All the moneys gone nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning turning back
Yellow lorry slow nowhere to go
But oh that magic feeling nowhere to go
Oh that magic feeling nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags get in the limousine
Soon well be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes it did
One two three four five six seven
All good children go to Heaven
One two three four five six seven
All good children go to Heaven

The Beatles,"When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Yeah there will be an answer let it be
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on til tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer let it be

The Beatles,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise"
Johnny Cash,"O Death where is thy sting
O Grave where is thy victory
O Life you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me
Oh row my ship over the waves of your sea
Let me find a safe port now and then
Dont let the dark one in your sanctuary
Until its time to pack it in
O row row my ship
With the fire of your breath
And dont lay a broadside on your ship as yet
Blow ye warm winds
When its chilly and wet
And dont come to soon yet
For collecting my debt
O Death where is thy sting
O Grave where is thy victory
O Life you are a shining path
And hope springs eternal just over the rise
When I see my redeemer beckoning me
Oh let me sail on
With my ship to the East
And keep my eye on the North Star
When the journey is no good for man or for beast
Ill be safe wherever you are
Just let me sail into your harbor of lights
And there and forever to cast out my line
Give me my task
And let me do it right
And do it with all of my might"
Johnny Cash,"I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because youre mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes Ill admit that Im a fool for you
Because youre mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness Ive known proves that its right
Because youre mine I walk the line
Youve got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I cant hide
For you I know Id even try to turn the tide
Because youre mine I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because youre mine I walk the line"
Johnny Cash,"Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring"
Johnny Cash,"You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Go tell that longtongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler the backbiter
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
My heads been wet with the midnight dew
Ive been down on bended knee talkin to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said John go do My will
Go tell that longtongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler the backbiter
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
Whats done in the dark will be brought to the light
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Go tell that longtongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider

Johnny Cash,"I was thinking about you guys yesterday Now Ive been here three times before and I think I understand a little bit of how you feel about some things Its none of my business how you feel about some other things and I dont give a damn about how you feel about some other things But anyway I tried to put myself in your place and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin
San Quentin youve been livin hell to me
Youve hosted me since nineteen sixty three
Ive seen em come and go and Ive seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why
San Quentin I hate every inch of you
Youve cut me and have scarred me through and through
And Ill walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman you cant understand
San Quentin what good do you think you do
Do you think Ill be different when youre through
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin youve been living hell to me
Thank you very much One more time Maybe before we do it though if any of the guards are still speaking to me can I have a glass of water
laughter applause"
Taylor Swift,"You were in college working parttime waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say Can you believe it
As were lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Flash forward and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
And I remember that fight 230 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone
You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine
Hold on make it last
Hold on never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Yeah yeah
Do you believe it Hold on
Were gonna make it now Hold on
And I can see it
Yeah yeah
I can see it now See it now"
Taylor Swift,"Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it alright
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"
Taylor Swift,"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bridetobe
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me Dont you
Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said Speak now
Ooh ladadada oh
Ooh ooh
Say a single vow
I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence theres my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Hehe
So dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
And you say Lets run away now
Ill meet you when Im out
Of my tux at the back door
Baby I didnt say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said Speak now"
Taylor Swift,"You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all so quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake
Whoa holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead
Oh holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
I know I know
I just know
Youre not gone
You cant be gone no
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I cant go back Im haunted
Ohoh ohoh ohoh oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it"
Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough for me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see"
Prince,"Dont worry I wont hurt you
I only want you to have some fun
I was dreamin when I wrote this

Prince,"I guess I shouldve known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldnt last
See youre the kinda person that believes in makin out once
Love em and leave em fast
I guess I must be dumb cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night I guess that makes it all right
And you say  What have I got to lose
And honey I say Little Red Corvette
Baby youre much too fast Oh
Little Red Corvette
You need a love thats gonna last
I guess I shouldve closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night I guess that makes it all right
And you say Baby have you got enough gas
Oh yeah
Little Red Corvette
Baby youre much too fast
Yes you are
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love thats gonna last
Oh oh
A body like yours oughta be in jail

Move over baby gimme the keys

Little Red Corvette
Baby youre much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love thats gonna last hey hey
Little Red Corvette

Prince,"I see you picked me out from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar
Master of the soft not too loud
One day maybe I will be a star
I see you picked me out like you want something
Shame on you babe cant you see this ring
What do you want me to do girl
What do you want me to do babe
What do you want me to do girl
What do you want me to do babe

Prince,"Have you ever been so lonely
That you felt like you were the only one in this world
Have you ever wanted to play with someone so much
Youd take any one boy or girl
Anna Stesia come to me talk to me ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me praise me craze me
Out this space and time
Between white and black night and day
Black night seemed like the only way
So I danced
Music late nothing great
No way to differentiate
I took a chance
Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips to say
We could live for a little while
If you could just learn to smile
You and I could fly away fly away
Yeah
Anna Stesia come to me talk to me ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me praise me craze me

Prince,"Everyday when I wake up
Gotta make up
Another reason to make it last miss mistake up
If we break up
We smash guitars and shatter glass
But til the day that we do
Im your driver and youre my screw
Everywhere that we go now theres a show now
People pay money for the rock n roll
And the big wow
Before we bow
You can call me CC crowd control
If you dont want to its cool
Im your driver
Empty car on a fast train
In the driving rain
I can make you swear that you did some thang
What you dont know wont hurt you so
We got a long long way to go
Might as well enjoy the view
Im your driver and youre my screw
You said you were my screw
Sharing stories and cool clothes
And party toes
This is what life is like on the road
Never too high never too low
Thats the only way to go
But right now without further ado
Im your driver and youre my screw
Counterclockwise turn you round
All you got to do is listen to the sound
Music never lies you know its true
I aint even got to you know who
Time we got plenty of
Forevers worth the wait when it comes to love
Im your driver and youre my screw
Im your driver and youre my screw
Im your driver and youre my screw
Im your driver and youre my screw
Im your driver and youre my screw
Might as well enjoy the view
Im your driver and youre my screw"
Ed Sheeran,"I dont want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got backstabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now Oh oh
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Dont need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singerwriter youre just bluffing
Names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singerwriter like a Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop til my names in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on Arabian Nights
Because Im young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singersongwriter yeah
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows but
I havent got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when Im singing them out
Wow from day one Ive been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause its another day
Plus Ill keep my last name forever keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
Im selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
Im still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you"
Ed Sheeran,"White lips pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Lights gone days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause were just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she dont wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Wearyeyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause were just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she dont wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin for a better life
This time well fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And were all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we dont wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly fly
For angels to fly
To fly to fly
For angels to die"
Ed Sheeran,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didnt kill me it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now Ill maybe lean back there
Im sat here wishing I was sober
I know Ill never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold Ill be freezing
Cant rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like When you leaving me
Should I Should I
Maybe Ill get drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And Ive got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then Keep it between friends
Though I know youll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us burns dont heal like before
You dont hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the bands name
I know I cant heal things with a handshake
You know I cant change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I Should I
Maybe Ill get drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
Im here again
All by myself
You know Ill never change
All by myself
All by myself
Im just drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love"
Ed Sheeran,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that youve been here before
And I dont get waves of missing you anymore
Theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry so I get high
Smoke away the days never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And Im still drunk at the end of the night
I dont drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin Ive got
My minds with you but my hearts just not
So am I close to you anymore if its over
And theres no chance that well work it out
Thats why you and I
Ended over UNI
And I said thats fine
But youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over UNI
And I said thats fine
But youre the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said wed be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everythings great not everythings sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now Im in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And Im always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if its over
And theres no chance that well work it out
Oh you and I
Ended over UNI
And I said thats fine
But youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over UNI
And I said thats fine
But youre the only one that knows I lied
Because if I was gonna go somewhere Id be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down wooahh
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure Im not the only one to feel low
Because if you want Ill take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that Ive done wrong
And Ill know youll say that Im the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
Cause you and I
Ended over UNI
And I said thats fine
But youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over UNI
And I said thats fine
But youre the only one that knows I lied"
Ed Sheeran,"My mind is a warrior my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
Ill never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower were not done yet now
I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh Ill never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And Ill keep you around so Ill know
That Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But Ive never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Now youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But Ive never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down down
My eyes are a river filler this drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest against
Your body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again
I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh Ill never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And Ill keep you around so Ill know
That Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But Ive never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But Ive never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But Ive never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But Ive never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down"
Sia,"Help I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is theres noone else to blame
Be my friend hold me
Wrap me up unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend hold me
Wrap me up unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Be my friend hold me
Wrap me up unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me"
Sia,"Death by chocolate is a myth yeah
This I know because I lived oh
Ive been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl this is only right now
And death by crying doesnt exist oh
Though the headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode but you reach the end of the road
And you little tree Im certain you will grow
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend
And death by anger this is true oh
Just let him go he cant hurt you oh
Oh little girl this is such a cruel cruel world
This is the first of a million broken hearts
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong up up and away
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong up up and away
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong up up and away
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong up up and away
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong up up and away

Oh it wont be long you will grow strong up up and away
Oh hes but a falling leaf
Hes but a falling leaf hes but a falling leaf
Yeah hes but a falling leaf
Hes but a falling leaf hes but a falling leaf"
Sia,"Watching the sequence of sounds
Coming out of your mouth
But the snore is too loud
Follow the hands as they move
Try to make out your move
But my brain doesnt want to
Hide ooh the door
Silent call for you
What have I done to you
Kill and run kill and run
Im one of the dirty guns
Kill and run kill and run
A bullet through your heart
Interpret the eyes as they die
Should I cry Should I love
Your poor lashes blow
Victim of sensory love
You cry over my voice
An innocent call
Hide ooh the door
Silent call for you
What have I done to you
Kill and run kill and run
Im one of the dirty guns
Kill and run kill and run
A bullet through your heart
Kill and run kill kill and run
Im one of the dirty guns
Kill and run kill and run
A bullet through your heart"
Sia,"Party girls dont get hurt

Phones blowin up ringin my doorbell

One two three one two three drink
One two three one two three drink

Throw em back till I lose count

Demi Lovato,"Four years old with my back to the door
All I could hear was the family war
Your selfish hands always expecting more
Am I your child or just a charity ward
You have a hollowed out heart but its heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it but its hopeless
Hopeless youre hopeless
Oh father
Please father
Id love to leave you alone but I cant let you go
Oh father
Please father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh
Its been five years since weve spoken last
And you cant take back what we never had
Oh well I can be manipulated only so many times
Before even I love you starts to sound like a lie
You have a hollowed out heart but its heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it but its hopeless
Hopeless youre hopeless
Oh father
Please father
Id love to leave you alone but I cant let you go
Oh father
Please father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Dont you remember Im your baby girl
How could you push me out of your world
Lied to your flesh and your blood
Put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved
Dont you remember Im your baby girl
How could you throw me right out of your world
So young when the pain had begun
Now forever afraid of being loved
Oh father
Please father
Id love to leave you alone but I cant let you go
Oh father
Please father
Oh father
Please father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
For the love of a daughter"
Demi Lovato,"Skies are crying I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as its ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like theres nothing left of me
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like Im made of glass
Like Im made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed
All my windows still are broken but Im standing on my feet
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like Im made of glass
Like Im made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Go run run run
Im gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Yeah oh
Go run run run
Yeah its a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like Im made of glass
Like Im made of paper oh oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper"

Demi Lovato,"Its probably whats best for you
I only want the best for you
And if Im not the best then youre stuck
I tried to sever ties and I ended up with wounds to bind
Like youre pouring salt in my cuts
And I just ran out of bandaids
I dont even know where to start
Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Even though I know whats wrong
How could I be so sure if you never say what you feel feel
I mustve held your hand so tight
You didnt have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal
Baby I just ran out of bandaids
I dont even know where to start
Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Ooh oh oh
Oh oh yeah
Ooh oh oh
Oh oh oh yeah
You must be a miracle worker
Swearing up and down you cant fix whats been broken yeah
Please dont get my hopes up
No no
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel
Its like youre pouring salt on my cuts
Baby I just ran out of bandaids
I dont even know where to start
Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Baby I just ran out of bandaids
I dont even know where to start
Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no no no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no no no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh ooh
Oh yeah ooh ooh ooh ooh
You never really can fix my heart"
Demi Lovato,"I am confident but I still have my moments
Baby thats just me
Im not a supermodel I still eat McDonalds
Baby thats just me
Well some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well everythings the same in the la la land machine
Machine machine
Who said I cant wear my Converse with my dress
Well baby thats just me
Who said I cant be single and have to go out and mingle
Baby thats not me
No no
Well some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well everythings the same in the la la land
Tell me do you feel the way I feel
Cause nothing else is real in the la la land appeal
Some may say I need to be afraid of losing everything
Because of where I had my start and where I made my name
Well everythings the same in the la la land machine
Well Im not gonna change in the la la land machine
I will stay the same in the la la land
Machine
Machine machine
I wont change anything in my life
I wont change anything in my life
Im staying myself tonight
Im staying myself tonight
La la la la la"
