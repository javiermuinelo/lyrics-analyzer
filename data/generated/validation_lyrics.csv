The Beatles,"Well, I woke up late this morning,  
Sunlight dancing on my bed.  
Had a dream that you were calling,  
Softly singing in my head.  

Oh, I don't know where I'm going,  
But I know just where I've been.  
Through the laughter, through the sorrow,  
Back to you and home again.  

Take my hand and walk beside me,  
Through the fields so wild and free.  
All the world is turning slowly,  
Still you're all I'll ever need.  

Oh, I don't know where I'm going,  
But I know just where I've been.  
Through the laughter, through the sorrow,  
Back to you and home again.  

La-la-la, the wind is blowing,  
Carrying my heart to you.  
La-la-la, the river's flowing,  
Whispering our love is true.  

Oh, I don't know where I'm going,  
But I know just where I've been.  
Through the laughter, through the sorrow,  
Back to you and home again."
The Beatles,"I saw you walking down the street  
With a smile so bright and bittersweet  
I waved hello, you looked away  
Guess I'll just try another day  

The sun was shining on your hair  
But you pretended I wasn't there  
I took a step, you took two back  
Now I'm just staring at the cracks  

Oh, don't you know, don't you see  
You mean the world and more to me  
But if you go, if you stay  
I’ll still be here anyway  

I wrote a letter yesterday  
But I tore it up and threw away  
The words were right, the time was wrong  
So now I'm singing you this song  

Oh, don't you know, don't you see  
You mean the world and more to me  
But if you go, if you stay  
I’ll still be here anyway  

Maybe one day you'll turn around  
Find me standing safe and sound  
Till that moment, till that time  
I'll keep you close inside my mind  

Oh, don't you know, don't you see  
You mean the world and more to me  
But if you go, if you stay  
I’ll still be here anyway"
The Beatles,"I saw you walking down the lane  
Smiling bright through summer rain  
And oh, my heart skipped once again  

You turned around and caught my eye  
Like a bird that's meant to fly  
And now I just can't say goodbye  

Oh, don't you know it's true?  
Every little thing you do  
Makes the world seem bright and new  
Oh, don't you see it too?  
You're the song, the sweetest tune  
And I'm just lost in loving you  

We talked until the moon was high  
Counting stars up in the sky  
And time just seemed to pass us by  

You laughed and took me by the hand  
Spun me 'round like grains of sand  
And now I hope you understand  

Oh, don't you know it's true?  
Every little thing you do  
Makes the world seem bright and new  
Oh, don't you see it too?  
You're the song, the sweetest tune  
And I'm just lost in loving you  

So take a chance, don't be afraid  
The sun will shine, the rain will fade  
And love will never be too late  

Oh, don't you know it's true?  
Every little thing you do  
Makes the world seem bright and new  
Oh, don't you see it too?  
You're the song, the sweetest tune  
And I'm just lost in loving you"
The Beatles,"I saw you walking down the lane  
Smiling bright through the summer rain  
And I knew, oh I knew, right away  
That I'd never let you stray  

You turned around and met my eyes  
Like a dream under golden skies  
And you laughed, oh you laughed, so free  
Like a song inside of me  

But don't you run, don't you hide  
Darling, won't you stay by my side?  
Through the night, through the day  
We can chase all our troubles away  

The world is spinning much too fast  
But we'll make every moment last  
Hand in hand, oh so grand, we'll go  
Where the winding rivers flow  

So take a chance, take a flight  
Stay with me and hold on tight  
Through the storm, through the shine  
Darling, say that you'll be mine"
The Beatles,"I saw her walking down the lane  
With sunlight dancing in the rain  
She turned to me and gave a smile  
And said, ""Won't you stay a while?""  

Oh no, I can't believe it  
Oh no, she's got me dreaming  
I never thought I'd fall again  
But here I go  

She hums a tune I've never known  
But somehow it feels just like home  
Her laughter lingers in the air  
Like something more than just a prayer  

Oh no, I can't believe it  
Oh no, she's got me dreaming  
I never thought I'd fall again  
But here I go  

And when the night begins to fall  
She whispers, ""Maybe after all  
The things you seek are close at hand  
Just take the time to understand""  

Oh no, I can't believe it  
Oh no, she's got me dreaming  
I never thought I'd fall again  
But here I go  

Here I go..."
Queen,"Oh, the night’s on fire, feel the thunder roll  
Hearts are racing faster, can you lose control?  
Shadows dance around us, whispering my name  
Take my hand, we’re diving into fortune and fame  

Ooh, don’t look back, the past is gone  
We’re burning bright like the rising dawn  
No chains, no fear, just let it ride  
We’re kings of the stars with the world on our side  

Whoa, light it up, let the flames ignite  
We’re running on passion, electric tonight  
No turning back, no slowing down  
We’ll shake the heavens, we’ll rattle the ground  

Oh yeah!  

Feel the pulse, hear the sound, can you taste the dream?  
Every spark inside us is a laser beam  
No regrets, no surrender, take a mighty stand  
We’re the storm, we’re the legend, we’re the promised land  

Whoa, light it up, let the flames ignite  
We’re running on passion, electric tonight  
No turning back, no slowing down  
We’ll shake the heavens, we’ll rattle the ground  

Oh, destiny calls, hear the echo ring  
Ride the wave, let the choir sing  
One more chance, one last fight  
We will shine like the stars tonight!"
Queen,"Johnny was bold, heart made of gold  
Dreaming of thunder and fire  
Taking his chance, a wild little dance  
Stepping up higher and higher  

They told him, ""Boy, stay down on the ground,  
Keep your feet where they stand!""  
But Johnny just laughed, never looked back,  
Said, ""I’ve got the world in my hands!""  

Oh, the stars ignite when I take the stage,  
Feel the fire burning in my veins!  
I was born to shine, I was born to fly,  
I won’t be chained, I won’t be tamed tonight!  

He raced through the night, chasing the light,  
Never afraid of the fall  
Fortune and fame, a dangerous game,  
But Johnny would answer the call  

They said, ""Boy, you'll break, how much can you take?""  
But he just gave them a grin  
With fire in his eyes, he reached for the skies,  
Said, ""This is where I begin!""  

Oh, the stars ignite when I take the stage,  
Feel the fire burning in my veins!  
I was born to shine, I was born to fly,  
I won’t be chained, I won’t be tamed tonight!  

Oh, the echoes call from the mountaintops,  
Hear my name when the music stops!  
I was born to dream, I was born to fight,  
I won’t"
Queen,"Oh, the night is burnin’, feel the fire in my veins  
Like a thunder rollin’, breakin’ through the heavy chains  
I was lost in shadow, but I found my way to light  
Gonna rise like a fever, set the world in flames tonight  

Ohhh, can’t you hear it callin’?  
The sound of hearts ignitin’  
Ohhh, let the drums start poundin’  
A symphony of lightning  

Stand up! Stand tall!  
We were born to take it all  
No chains, no fear,  
We are fire, crystal clear  
Let the echoes ring forever  
Sing it loud, we’re born to shine  

I was just a dreamer, walkin’ blind without a name  
Now I stand a titan, never bound by loss or shame  
Took a fall, kept climbin’, never bowed to fate’s cruel hand  
Now the stars are callin’, and I’ll make my final stand  

Ohhh, can’t you hear it callin’?  
The sound of hearts ignitin’  
Ohhh, let the drums start poundin’  
A symphony of lightning  

Stand up! Stand tall!  
We were born to take it all  
No chains, no fear,  
We are fire, crystal clear  
Let the echoes ring forever  
Sing it loud, we’re born to shine  

Oh, the heavens shake, the earth will break  
But we will"
Queen,"Oh, the stars ignite the midnight sky  
Like a firework show for you and I  
Racing comets, silver streams  
Sail across our wildest dreams, oh yeah  

Ride the wind, feel the thunder roar  
Hearts are pounding, begging more  
Through the valleys, through the flames  
Nothing’s ever been the same, oh no  

We are the fire, burning bright  
Shooting higher through the night  
No chains can hold us, no walls confine  
We are endless, we are divine  

Ooooh, hear the echoes call our name  
Mountains crumble, hearts inflame  
On the edge, we rise, we shine  
This is our moment, yours and mine  

Oh, we are the fire, burning bright  
Shooting higher through the night  
No chains can hold us, no walls confine  
We are endless, we are divine  

Ahhhhh, ohhhh, yeah!"
Queen,"Thunder rolls and the sky is crying  
But I won't fall, no, I keep on flying  
Got a fire burning deep in my soul  
Taking control  

Left my doubts on the road behind me  
No regrets, no chains to bind me  
Every step, I'm a man on a mission  
Chasing the vision  

Oh, the night may try to break me  
Oh, but the stars will light my way  
No more fears to overtake me  
I'm rising high, I'm here to stay  

Lightning strikes but it cannot shake me  
I’ve got dreams and they won’t forsake me  
Every heartbeat sings out a warning  
New day is dawning  

Oh, the night may try to break me  
Oh, but the stars will light my way  
No more fears to overtake me  
I'm rising high, I'm here to stay  

So hear me now, the world keeps turning  
Feel my soul, it won’t stop burning  
On and on, I climb even higher  
Heart full of fire"
Bob Dylan,"Well, the wind keeps howlin’ through the sycamore trees  
A freight train moanin’ with a lonesome disease  
The moonlight is callin’, but I just can’t go  
Got a pocket full of nothin’ and a heart full of woe  

The preacher man’s talkin’ ‘bout the wages of sin  
But the gambler keeps smilin’ with a bottle of gin  
The clock on the tower, it don’t make a sound  
Just tickin’ off the minutes ‘til the sun comes down  

Oh, Rosie was dancin’ in a red silk dress  
Said she’d love me forever but I couldn’t care less  
Now the river keeps risin’ and my boots are wet  
And I ain’t seen the sunshine since the day that we met  

There’s a letter in my pocket that I never did read  
From a girl in the valley with a heart that could bleed  
But the road keeps a-rollin’ and my shoes are too thin  
And the wheel keeps spinnin’ like it just won’t end  

So I’ll tip my hat to the man at the door  
Tell ‘em I’ve been here too many times before  
The road’s getting longer and my shadow’s grown tall  
But I ain’t gonna stop ‘til I lose it all"
Bob Dylan,"Well, the river runs wide and the water runs deep  
I walk these roads but I don’t find no sleep  
The wind keeps callin’, whisperin’ my name  
But every turn I take just looks the same  

The preacher man tells me to bow down and pray  
Says the gates of heaven ain’t too far away  
But I’ve been knockin’, I’ve been left in the cold  
Nothin’ but echoes and stories untold  

Oh, the train rolls by, hummin’ low in the night  
Carryin’ ghosts in the pale moonlight  
I could buy me a ticket, take me somewhere new  
But wherever I go, I still think of you  

Well, the gambler lost and the miner went blind  
The poet got drunk tryin’ to outrun his mind  
The lovers they whisper, the liars they shout  
I keep movin’ on ‘cause there ain’t no way out  

So tell me, my darlin’, where do I stand?  
With dust on my boots and a map in my hand  
The road keeps changin’, the signs disappear  
But I’ll keep on walkin’ ‘til I ain’t nowhere near"
Bob Dylan,"The lamplight flickers on the pavement  
Shadows dance against the wall  
A preacher shouts down on the corner  
But no one's listening at all  

The river hums a lonesome warning  
The old clock tower's lost its chime  
A beggar sings of faded glory  
As the train rolls past the line  

Oh, the wind don't wait for mercy  
It don't stop to hear you cry  
It moves just like a thief at midnight  
Taking all you left behind  

The gambler shakes his broken promise  
Cards are scattered on the floor  
A widow waits beside the station  
For a love that comes no more  

Oh, the wind don't wait for mercy  
It don't stop to hear you cry  
It moves just like a thief at midnight  
Taking all you left behind  

A poet scribbles on a napkin  
Words he swears he'll never read  
A soldier dreams of distant thunder  
And the blood upon the sea  

Oh, the wind don't wait for mercy  
It don't stop to hear you cry  
It moves just like a thief at midnight  
Taking all you left behind"
Bob Dylan,"Well, the wind rolled in from the eastern tide  
Carried my name where the lost souls hide  
I met a man with a broken smile  
Said, ""Boy, you best keep runnin' wild""  

Smoke was rising from the valley below  
Shadows danced in the firelight's glow  
A woman cried with a voice so thin  
Said, ""Ain't no use, you can't outrun sin""  

The preacher stood on a worn-out crate  
Spoke of love but he preached of hate  
I tipped my hat, said, ""I’ve heard it all""  
Then walked away as the sky turned small  

Rivers run and the seasons fade  
A beggar laughs in the evening shade  
Cards are dealt but the game ain't fair  
And the queen of spades don’t seem to care  

So I keep on walkin', boots untied  
Down a road where the lonesome ride  
The sun may set, the stars may burn  
But I ain't got time for no return"
Bob Dylan,"Well the wind it howls through the alley  
And the rain taps soft on the street  
There's a man in a coat by the station  
With a suitcase laid down at his feet  

He once had a house by the river  
Where the sparrows would dance in the light  
But the bank took his name off the paper  
And he vanished alone in the night  

Oh the judge wore a smile like a dagger  
And the clerk never blinked at the plea  
They said all of the numbers weren’t adding  
And the locks took the place of the key  

Now he walks with the ghosts of the morning  
Through the echoes of places he's been  
And he hums an old song without meaning  
Like a prayer that won’t let him in  

So he waits in the cold by the platform  
For a train that was lost long ago  
But the whistle don’t blow like it used to  
And the tracks are all covered in snow"
Taylor Swift,"I still hear your laughter  
Like a song stuck in my mind  
Every street feels like our story  
Every corner frozen in time  

You swore the stars would guide us  
But now they’re quiet in the sky  
I trace your name in condensation  
And watch the letters say goodbye  

Oh, you're the echo in my heart  
Fading slow but never far  
I try to move, I try to run  
But love like ours can't come undone  

I see your shadow in the mirror  
Like you're standing next to me  
But when I turn, it's just the silence  
And a ghost of what used to be  

Oh, you're the echo in my heart  
Fading slow but never far  
I try to move, I try to run  
But love like ours can't come undone  

And maybe in some other life  
We get it right, we find the light  
But in this one, all I can do  
Is keep the pieces left of you  

Oh, you're the echo in my heart  
Fading slow but never far  
I try to move, I try to run  
But love like ours can't come undone  

Still hear your laughter  
Like a song stuck in my mind  
But the melody is changing  
And I'm learning to say goodbye"
Taylor Swift,"You left your jacket on my front porch  
Like a ghost of who we used to be  
Faded denim, torn at the edges  
Just like the way you walked out on me  

And I swore I wouldn’t call you  
Swore I’d let you fade away  
But your shadow’s in my doorway  
Like it’s begging me to stay  

Oh, I wish I could hate you, but I don’t  
Every time I try, my heart says no  
You’re the song stuck in my head  
That I can’t forget, no matter where I go  

Midnight drives down empty highways  
Still hear you singing in my car  
Guess I never learned the right way  
To let go of what we are  

And I swore I wouldn’t need you  
Swore that I’d be doing fine  
But I’m staring at your jacket  
Like it’s holding me in time  

Oh, I wish I could hate you, but I don’t  
Every time I try, my heart says no  
You’re the song stuck in my head  
That I can’t forget, no matter where I go  

So I leave the porch light burning  
In case you find your way back home  
But the wind keeps on returning  
All the words we left untold  

Oh, I wish I could hate you, but I don’t  
Every time I try, my heart says no  
You’re the song stuck in my head  
That"
Taylor Swift,"I still hear your voice in the quiet  
Like a song I don’t wanna forget  
Late night drives down 4th and Highland  
Radio up, but you're in my head  

I wear your hoodie when I’m lonely  
Even though it don’t smell like you now  
Told myself that I’d be fine, but  
I still can’t figure this out  

Oh, love, it don’t just disappear  
You swore that you’d always be here  

But you let go like it meant nothing  
Left me standing in the pouring rain  
Now I’m holding onto echoes  
Of a love that only knew my name  
You walked away so easy, baby  
While I’m still learning how to breathe  
Tell me, was it ever real?  
Or was it just a dream?  

I see your car on every corner  
Even though I know it's not you  
Guess my heart's still catching up to  
What my mind already knew  

And I could rewrite every promise  
But it won’t bring you back to me  
Some stories don't get their ending  
Some hearts never set free  

Oh, love, it don’t just disappear  
You swore that you’d always be here  

But you let go like it meant nothing  
Left me standing in the pouring rain  
Now I’m holding onto echoes  
Of a love that only knew my name  
You walked away so easy, baby  
While I’m still learning how to breathe  
Tell me"
Taylor Swift,"I saw your car pull up, headlights dancing in the rain  
Same old leather jacket, but you never look the same  
You say it's just a visit, just a stop along the way  
But I know better, I know better  

You trace the rim of your glass like you're drawing a map  
Looking for the right words, but I see through all of that  
You ask if I've been happy, like you really wanna know  
But I know better, I know better  

Oh, you only miss me when you're lonely  
Only call me when it's late  
Like a song stuck in your memory  
That you can't quite replicate  
You always leave me in the morning  
Like a ghost slips through the door  
And I swear I'm done believing  
But I let you in once more  

You say it’s complicated, but the truth is crystal clear  
You love the way I hold you, but you never keep me near  
And every time I tell myself I’ll finally let this go  
But I know better, I know better  

Oh, you only miss me when you're lonely  
Only call me when it's late  
Like a song stuck in your memory  
That you can't quite replicate  
You always leave me in the morning  
Like a ghost slips through the door  
And I swear I'm done believing  
But I let you in once more  

This time I won’t be waiting  
This time I won’t pretend  
That you’ll stay past the sunrise  
That"
Taylor Swift,"I used to dance in the glow of your headlights  
Spinning around like the world was ours  
Laughing too loud on a runaway midnight  
Tracing our names in the frost on your car  

You swore that love was a fire that never fades  
But now you're just a ghost in the mess we made  

Oh, I wish I didn't know what I know now  
That forever was just words in your mouth  
I was holding on, but you let go somehow  
And I can't unlearn the way this feels now  

I see your face in the cracks of the pavement  
Hear your voice in the songs on the radio  
You said we'd never be one of those endings  
But look at us now, we're a story untold  

I swore that time would erase all the damage done  
But here in the dark, you're still the only one  

Oh, I wish I didn't know what I know now  
That forever was just words in your mouth  
I was holding on, but you let go somehow  
And I can't unlearn the way this feels now  

Maybe you'll find me in some faded memory  
A picture, a moment, a song on repeat  
But I can't keep waiting for what we won't be  
So I'll let you go, even if it breaks me  

Oh, I wish I didn't know what I know now  
That forever was just words in your mouth  
I was holding on, but you let go somehow  
And I can't un"
Ed Sheeran,"I’ve been tracing all the cracks in the pavement  
Thinking ‘bout the nights that we wasted  
You were laughing in the glow of the streetlights  
Now I’m walking home alone in the midnight  

And I still hear your voice in the echoes  
Soft like the rain on my window  
Every memory’s a song I keep playing  
But the melody’s fading, it’s changing  

Oh, we burned like a fire in the coldest dark  
Now I'm holding the smoke in an empty heart  
You were my shelter, my safest place  
Now I'm lost in a town that still holds your name  

I keep replaying all the words that were spoken  
Wondering if we were bent or just broken  
Love was a flame but we let it die slowly  
Now I’m just a ghost in a story you told me  

Oh, we burned like a fire in the coldest dark  
Now I'm holding the smoke in an empty heart  
You were my shelter, my safest place  
Now I'm lost in a town that still holds your name  

Maybe time will turn the page  
Maybe love comes back someday  
But for now, I'm just a shadow  
On a road that leads away  

Oh, we burned like a fire in the coldest dark  
Now I'm holding the smoke in an empty heart  
You were my shelter, my safest place  
Now I'm lost in a town that still holds your name"
Ed Sheeran,"Late night, headlights, walking home alone again  
Footsteps echo, memories that I can't defend  
City hums a melody I used to know  
But every street sign whispers where you used to go  

Pulled your sweater from the drawer, it still smells like July  
Faded notes upon the wall, scribbled words, your lullaby  
I trace the letters, but they blur beneath my touch  
Guess I never learned how to give up  

So I keep on holding on to ghosts  
Dancing in the dark with what I miss the most  
Your voice still lingers in the air  
Like you’re standing right there  
But I know, I know, I know—it's just a shadow  

Raindrops race against the glass, just like we used to do  
Sunday mornings, tangled sheets, coffee cups for two  
Now I'm left with echoes of a love that slipped away  
But I still hear your laughter in the words I never say  

So I keep on holding on to ghosts  
Dancing in the dark with what I miss the most  
Your voice still lingers in the air  
Like you’re standing right there  
But I know, I know, I know—it's just a shadow  

And I should move on, yeah, I should let go  
Pack up the past like an old love note  
But every time, I close my eyes  
You're still there, you're still mine  

So I keep on holding on to ghosts"
Ed Sheeran,"I remember the way that you laughed in the rain  
Spinning circles, no worry, no weight in your veins  
We were kids chasing time like it couldn't run out  
Now we're older, but somehow still lost in the doubt  

All the late night drives with the windows down  
Singing songs we swore we'd never live without  
But the echoes fade and the roads move on  
Guess we never knew what we had till it’s gone  

So tell me, do you ever look back like I do?  
Tracing all the memories, searching for the truth  
If I called you up, would it feel the same?  
Or are we just a story that time couldn't save?  

I still see your name in the back of my mind  
Like a song that I wrote but I lost half the lines  
And maybe we were meant to fade like the tide  
But I swear I still feel you here sometimes"
Ed Sheeran,"Woke up to the sunrise slipping through the curtains  
Coffee in the air but my heart's still hurtin'  
Traced your name on the glass where the mist is certain  
Fading like the words that we left unspoken  

I still hear your laughter in the kitchen light  
Dancing in my sweater, it was way too tight  
Now the echoes linger in the dead of night  
Like a song unfinished, missing half the lines  

Oh, love, it don’t just disappear  
Still feel you everywhere  
Like a melody stuck in the air  
Oh, love, I wish you’d turn around  
But you're just a ghost town  
In a heart that won’t settle down  

Left a note on the table that you never read  
All the little things I should’ve done instead  
Now the records spinning but it's all in my head  
Playing all the memories of words unsaid  

Oh, love, it don’t just disappear  
Still feel you everywhere  
Like a melody stuck in the air  
Oh, love, I wish you’d turn around  
But you're just a ghost town  
In a heart that won’t settle down"
Ed Sheeran,"I trace the raindrops on my window  
Counting every one like time we lost  
Still hear your voice in the quiet echo  
Fading like the summer in the frost  

I swore that I could hold you closer  
But love don’t listen when we pray  
Now all I’ve got’s a worn-out sweater  
And words I never found to say  

So tell me, do you still remember  
The way we danced under city lights?  
Or have the seasons turned forever  
Leaving me alone with sleepless nights?  

Oh, I wish that I could call you  
Say the things I left unsaid  
But the past don’t wait for no one  
And I’m talking to your ghost instead"
Demi Lovato,"I don’t recognize myself  
Staring in this shattered glass  
The echoes of what used to be  
Are fading out too fast  

Oh, I’ve been running in circles  
Chasing a high that won’t last  
Every promise, every whisper  
Slipping like sand through my hands  

But I won’t break, I won’t bend  
I’m stronger than I’ve ever been  
Through the fire, through the pain  
I’m rising up, I’m not afraid  

Oh-oh, I feel the thunder in my veins  
Oh-oh, no more drowning in the rain  
I lost myself but now I see  
I’m the only one I need  

Every night was a battleground  
Fighting shadows in the dark  
I let the fear take over me  
Forgot the power in my heart  

But I won’t break, I won’t bend  
I’m stronger than I’ve ever been  
Through the fire, through the pain  
I’m rising up, I’m not afraid  

Oh-oh, I feel the thunder in my veins  
Oh-oh, no more drowning in the rain  
I lost myself but now I see  
I’m the only one I need  

I’m done with waiting, done with doubt  
The past can’t hold me, I’m breaking out  
No more chains, no more scars  
I’m shining brighter than the stars  

Oh-oh, I feel the thunder in my veins  
Oh-oh, no more drowning in the"
Demi Lovato,"Mmm yeah  
I’ve been running from the mirror  
Scared of my own shadow  
Hiding in the echoes  
Trying to drown out all the whispers  
Saying I’m not enough  
But I’ve had enough  

Oh, I’ve been breaking, bending  
Holding on, pretending  
Like I don’t feel the weight of it all  
But I’m done with the faking  
Time to start embracing  
Who I am when I start to fall  

All I ever really wanted  
Was someone to see me this clear  
No more hiding in the silence  
I’m done with the fear  
I’ve been lost but now I’m finding  
Every piece of me right here  

Mmm yeah  
I’ve been shattered, I’ve been shaken  
Tangled in my past  
But I’m rising up at last  
Every scar is just a lesson  
I won’t run away  
No, not today  

Oh, I’ve been breaking, bending  
Holding on, pretending  
Like I don’t feel the weight of it all  
But I’m done with the faking  
Time to start embracing  
Who I am when I start to fall  

All I ever really wanted  
Was someone to see me this clear  
No more hiding in the silence  
I’m done with the fear  
I’ve been lost but now I’m finding  
Every piece of me right here  

Ohhh, I’m done running  
I’m done fighting  
I’m done hiding"
Demi Lovato,"I’ve been running through the fire just to feel alive  
Every battle, every scar, yeah, they’re carved inside  
Tried to drown out all the voices, but they whisper still  
Telling me I’ll never make it, that I never will  

But I’ve been breaking, bending, learning how to stand  
Took the pieces, built a kingdom with my own two hands  

Now I’m rising from the embers, burning brighter than before  
Every tear became a lesson, I’m not crying anymore  
Oh, you tried to keep me down, but I was made to touch the sky  
Now I’m stronger, now I’m fearless, you can’t break me, don’t you try  

I remember every moment when I fell too deep  
Every promise that was broken, left me lost at sea  
But I found the light inside me, let it pull me through  
Now the storm can’t shake me, I know what to do  

Now I’m rising from the embers, burning brighter than before  
Every tear became a lesson, I’m not crying anymore  
Oh, you tried to keep me down, but I was made to touch the sky  
Now I’m stronger, now I’m fearless, you can’t break me, don’t you try  

Oh, I was lost, I was weak, I was barely holding on  
Now I know, now I see, I was strong all along  

Now I’m rising from"
Demi Lovato,"Midnight secrets, burning bright  
Heart is racing, holding tight  
Say the word, I'll let you in  
Feel the fire on my skin  

Are we crazy? Maybe so  
But I don't wanna take it slow  
Close your eyes and count to ten  
Take my hand, let's fall again  

Oh, we're running on the edge tonight  
No regrets, just neon lights  
Feel the rush, it's do or die  
No turning back, just you and I  

Fingers tracing, lips collide  
Lost in moments we can't hide  
If it's wrong, I don't care  
Let them talk, let them stare  

Oh, we're running on the edge tonight  
No regrets, just neon lights  
Feel the rush, it's do or die  
No turning back, just you and I"
Demi Lovato,"I gave you love, I gave you trust, I gave you all my time  
But you were running circles, never let me cross the line  
Maybe I should’ve seen  
Maybe I should’ve seen  

You built me up just to watch me break  
Told me lies with a smile on your face  
But I’m not crying, no, I’m not weak  
You lost your chance, now it's mine to keep  

I’m stronger now, don’t need you here  
I faced the fire, I faced my fear  
You tried to pull me down so low  
But watch me rise, watch me go  

I was drowning, I was lost, but now I see the truth  
You never wanted love, you only wanted proof  
That you could play the game  
That you could shift the blame  

Now I’m standing tall on my own two feet  
Turned my pain into melody  
You can watch but you can’t touch  
Boy, you lost your hold on me  

I’m stronger now, don’t need you here  
I faced the fire, I faced my fear  
You tried to pull me down so low  
But watch me rise, watch me go  

No more waiting, no more cries  
I found my wings, I found my light  
You had your shot, now say goodbye  
I’m done with you, I’m done with lies  

I’m stronger now, don’t need you here  
I faced the fire,"
Sia,"Moonlight drips on shattered glass  
Echoes dance as footsteps pass  
Silver whispers call my name  
But all they bring is love and pain  

Oh, I rise, I fall, I break  
But I won’t bend, I won’t fade  
Like a fire in the storm  
I keep burning, I’ll be born  

Hold me high, don’t let me drown  
Spinning fast, don’t pull me down  
I am lightning, I am free  
No more chains, I’m finally me  

Heartbeats loud like crashing waves  
Dressed in gold but still afraid  
Every shadow knows my scars  
But I still reach for higher stars  

Oh, I rise, I fall, I break  
But I won’t bend, I won’t fade  
Like a fire in the storm  
I keep burning, I’ll be born  

Hold me high, don’t let me drown  
Spinning fast, don’t pull me down  
I am lightning, I am free  
No more chains, I’m finally me"
Sia,"I want light, I wanna feel it  
I want fire, let me steal it  
I want hope, I wanna heal it  
I want, I want  

Hold me close, don’t let me shatter  
Lift me up, make the dark scatter  
I’ve been lost, but it don’t matter  
I rise, I rise  

Oh, I’m breaking through the thunder  
Oh, I won’t let the night pull me under  

I’m electric, I’m alive  
Burning brighter every time  
Hear me roaring through the sky  
I won’t, I won’t fade away  

I want love, I wanna take it  
I want dreams, I’m gonna chase it  
I want life, I’m gonna make it  
I shine, I shine  

Oh, I’m breaking through the thunder  
Oh, I won’t let the night pull me under  

I’m electric, I’m alive  
Burning brighter every time  
Hear me roaring through the sky  
I won’t, I won’t fade away"
Sia,"I rise up from the ashes high  
Flames dance but they can't touch my sky  
I was lost in the dark so deep  
Now I'm waking, I won't go to sleep  

Oh, I was sinking, I was breaking  
All my fears, they left me shaking  
But I won't, no, I won't fall down  
No, I won't, no, I won't drown  

I'm a wildfire burning free  
No chains are ever holding me  
Let the thunder crash and cry  
I will soar, I will survive  

Tears fell like a storm untamed  
Winds screamed but I called my name  
Through the wreckage, I found my gold  
Turned my sorrow into something bold  

Oh, I was sinking, I was breaking  
All my fears, they left me shaking  
But I won't, no, I won't fall down  
No, I won't, no, I won't drown  

I'm a wildfire burning free  
No chains are ever holding me  
Let the thunder crash and cry  
I will soar, I will survive  

Higher, higher, hear me rising  
Strike me down, I'll keep igniting  
Higher, higher, hear me calling  
Storms may come but I'm not falling  

I'm a wildfire burning free  
No chains are ever holding me  
Let the thunder crash and cry  
I will soar, I will survive"
Sia,"I rise, I rise, though the weight is on my shoulders  
I fight, I fight, through the echoes growing colder  
They try to break me, tie me down, but I’m still breathing  
Lightning crashing in my veins, you won’t see me leaving  

Oh, I glow in the dark, set fire to my scars  
Turn the pain into stars, watch me light up the sky  
Oh, I won’t fade away, I was never afraid  
Turn the night into day, watch me light up the sky  

I run, I run, through the storm without a warning  
I burn, I burn, with a heart that keeps on roaring  
They try to shake me, pull me back, but I stand steady  
Shadows chase me, but I know that I am ready  

Oh, I glow in the dark, set fire to my scars  
Turn the pain into stars, watch me light up the sky  
Oh, I won’t fade away, I was never afraid  
Turn the night into day, watch me light up the sky  

Higher, higher, I climb through the fire  
Brighter, brighter, I shine through the wire  

Oh, I glow in the dark, set fire to my scars  
Turn the pain into stars, watch me light up the sky  
Oh, I won’t fade away, I was never afraid  
Turn the night into day, watch me light up the sky  

Watch me light up the"
Sia,"I keep on running, but I’m stuck in place  
I scream your name, but it fades to space  
To space  
I scream your name, but it fades to space  

You built me up just to watch me fall  
Left me hanging, no net at all  
At all  
Left me hanging, no net at all  

But I, I won’t break, I won’t shatter  
Though I’m drowning in the after  
I will rise, I will climb  
Even lost, I’ll find the light  
Oh, I, I won’t break, I won’t shatter  
Though I’m drowning in the after  

You pulled me close just to push me away  
Played with fire like it’s all a game  
A game  
Played with fire like it’s all a game  

But I, I won’t break, I won’t shatter  
Though I’m drowning in the after  
I will rise, I will climb  
Even lost, I’ll find the light  
Oh, I, I won’t break, I won’t shatter  
Though I’m drowning in the after  

No more echoes in the dark  
No more pieces torn apart  
I’m still standing, I’m still whole  
You won’t take my heart and soul  

Oh, I, I won’t break, I won’t shatter  
Though I’m drowning in the after  
I will rise, I will climb  
Even lost, I’ll find the"
Eminem,"Yo, look—I'm losin' my mind in a bottle of Jack,  
Tryna swallow the past, but it follows me back,  
Got a wallet of cash, but it hollow and black,  
Cause the dollars don't patch up the problems I stack.  

I'm a runaway train on a crash course,  
Every thought in my brain like a task force,  
Tryna raid through the pain, but the past scorched,  
Every bridge that I built, now my path's torched.  

Nah, I ain't askin' for pity or praise,  
I been trapped in this city for minimum wage,  
Every syllable's rage, every visual fades,  
Into memories I bury when I'm scribblin' page.  

They say ""Slim, you should chill, man, you did it, you made it,""  
But I still feel like a villain who’s livin’ sedated,  
All the critics debate it, all the gimmicks are jaded,  
I'm just tryna keep my mind from gettin’ chemically faded.  

I ain't tryna be the GOAT, I ain't tryna be a saint,  
I'm just tryna stay afloat on a tidal wave of hate,  
If my rivals wanna play, let ‘em lie awake and pray,  
I'ma carve my own name while I’m fightin' through the pain."
Eminem,"Yo, I'm back with a brain full of static, erratic,  
Spit so sharp, every bar is a hatchet, I snatch it,  
Thoughts run wild like a pack full of rabbits,  
Try to keep up, but you lack in the habits.  

They say I’m a menace, a verbal lieutenant,  
I step in the booth and I burn it in minutes,  
My lyrics acidic, they sizzle like Guinness,  
You talkin’ but really, you ain't got no business.  

Back in the day I was broke and rejected,  
Now I got checks that I never expected,  
Haters still lurkin’, they watchin’ my blessings,  
Funny how envy can turn to obsession.  

I’m laughin’, I’m stackin’, I’m causin’ a racket,  
You fumble the bag while I cash it and pack it,  
They mumble, they stumble, they backtrack in panic,  
I’m runnin’ this game like I hacked into Madden.  

Got ‘em like whoa,  
He back in the zone,  
Spittin’ like bullets that fracture ya bones,  
I do this alone, don’t answer my phone,  
Unless it's the bank, then throw me a loan."
Eminem,"Yo, I wake up in a cold sweat, heart poundin’, fists clenched  
Dreams full of demons screamin’, tryna climb up this trench  
Every step I take, it’s like the ground just caves in  
Pressure on my chest, man, I swear I feel caged in  

They say, “Marshall, you made it, you rich, why you stressin’?”  
But money don't erase all the pain and the lessons  
Got a mansion with a view, still feel trapped in a cell  
Success like a prison when you livin’ in hell  

I hear the echoes of critics, they laughin’, they doubtin’  
Sayin’, “You ain't what you was,” man, I’m sick of they shoutin’  
I built this from the dirt with my blood and my bones  
Now they wanna see me fall, wanna strip down my throne  

But I ain't backin’ down, nah, I ain't never been weak  
I chew these rappers up, spit ‘em out on the beat  
I been battlin’ my demons, got war scars to show  
Every lyric that I spit, man, it’s cut from my soul  

Yeah, I been to rock bottom, I done stared at the edge  
Had a bottle in my palm, voices talkin' in my head  
But I shook off the darkness, told myself, ""Get up!""  
Now I’m back with a vengeance,"
Eminem,"Yeah, they said I'd never make it, now they watchin' in amazement  
Came up from the basement, now the roof's the only placement  
Used to get ignored, now they blowin' up my station  
Funny how they switch when they see the elevation  

I was broke, barely breathin', now I’m feastin' on my demons  
Told myself to keep believin', now my dreams ain't just a feelin'  
They was laughin', now they silent, guess the joke ain't that appealin'  
They was doubtin', now they shoutin', guess my words been too revealin'  

I ain't changed, I evolved, had to break outta the mold  
Had to face what I was told, turn my pain into some gold  
They was hopin' I would fold, now they actin' like they know  
Like they always been around, like they helped me on this road  

Nah, you ain't with me when I struggled, when I bled for this  
When I stayed up every night, writin’ verses, chasin’ bliss  
Now they wanna take a slice, tryna act like they assist  
But when I needed help, them motherfuckers ain't exist  

So miss me with the fake love, miss me with the lies  
Miss me with the stories 'bout how you was on my side  
I remember cold nights, I remember dark skies  
I remember fightin"
Johnny Cash,"Well I woke up early with the sun in my eyes  
Heard that old train moanin' down the line  
Pulled on my boots and I said my grace  
Ain't got much but I know my place  

The road is long and the night is cold  
I'm runnin' from trouble but it's takin' hold  
Got a heart like fire and a soul like stone  
Ain't got no home, but I'm never alone  

I met a man with a Bible in his hand  
Said, ""Son, you got to take a stand""  
I shook my head, tipped my hat down low  
Told him, ""Preacher, there's things you don't know""  

The road is long and the night is cold  
I'm runnin' from trouble but it's takin' hold  
Got a heart like fire and a soul like stone  
Ain't got no home, but I'm never alone  

There's a woman waitin' in a one-horse town  
With a weary heart and a wedding gown  
But a ramblin' man ain't meant to stay  
So I kissed her cheek and I walked away  

The road is long and the night is cold  
I'm runnin' from trouble but it's takin' hold  
Got a heart like fire and a soul like stone  
Ain't got no home, but I'm never alone  

So pour me a drink and deal me in  
I'll play my hand, lose"
Johnny Cash,"Well, I woke up late this mornin’, sun was high up in the sky  
Had a bottle on my nightstand and a feelin’ I can’t deny  
There’s a letter on the table, with my name wrote clear and bold  
Said she’s tired of all my ramblin’, tired of nights so dark and cold  

Well, I told her I’d be better, but the road it called my name  
Drivin’ down that lonesome highway, every town just feels the same  
Got my boots upon the dashboard, got my heart weighed down in stone  
Ain’t no use in turnin’ back now, some men’s souls weren’t built for home  

Well, the lawman’s been a-watchin’, sayin’ I done wrong before  
But a man just needs his freedom, can’t be locked behind no door  
So I’ll ride on past the sunrise, let the wind just guide my way  
Ain’t no sinner, ain’t no savior, just a man who’s gone astray  

So if you see me by the roadside, with my thumb stuck in the air  
Don’t go askin’ where I’m headed, don’t go askin’ why I care  
I was born to keep on movin’, born to chase that settin’ sun  
And I’ll die with boots upon me, when my ramblin’ days are done"
Johnny Cash,"Well I walked down to the riverbed  
With a heavy heart and a weary head  
The water whispered soft and low  
""Son, there's things you ought to know""  

I’ve chased the gold, I’ve fought the fight  
I’ve burned my share of midnight light  
But every road I walked alone  
Led me right back to the stone  

The stone where I first knelt to pray  
Where mama's tears still stain the clay  
She told me, ""Boy, don’t lose your soul  
A man ain't nothing if he ain't whole""  

Well, I rode hard, I rode fast  
Left my shadow in the past  
But the devil, he don't sleep at night  
And he don’t rest till he’s got you tight  

Now I stand where the river flows  
The cold wind cuts, the thunder rolls  
And I hear mama's voice again  
Calling soft through the howling wind  

""Son, come home, let go of pain  
No man outruns the falling rain""  
So I laid my burden in the sand  
And took my Maker by the hand"
Johnny Cash,"I woke up this mornin’ with dust on my boots  
A long road behind me, a past full of roots  
The sun’s burnin’ hot on this lonesome old trail  
But I keep on ridin’, too tough to derail  

The river runs deep, and the wind howls low  
A shadow behind me, nowhere to go  
But I ain’t no stranger to heartache and pain  
I’ll keep on movin’ like a runaway train  

I’ve seen dark highways and I’ve heard the call  
Of a woman who loved me then left with it all  
Cards on the table, the whiskey runs dry  
But I ain’t the kind just to lay down and cry  

The river runs deep, and the wind howls low  
A shadow behind me, nowhere to go  
But I ain’t no stranger to heartache and pain  
I’ll keep on movin’ like a runaway train  

Someday my boots will be still in the dust  
My hands folded quiet, my iron will rust  
But ‘til that day comes, I’ll ride through the rain  
A man on a mission, a soul without chain  

The river runs deep, and the wind howls low  
A shadow behind me, nowhere to go  
But I ain’t no stranger to heartache and pain  
I’ll keep on movin’ like a runaway train"
Johnny Cash,"Well I woke up cold at the break of dawn  
With the wind howlin’ low and the coffee gone  
A lonesome road and a heavy load  
And a heart that don't call nowhere home  

The train rolls by with a lonesome cry  
Like a ghost just passin’ in the night  
I tip my hat to the fading track  
A drifter’s life ain't made for backin’ tight  

Oh the river runs but it don’t look back  
Through the hills and the dust and the railroad track  
I keep on walkin’, keep on prayin’  
But the good Lord knows I ain't stayin’  

She told me once, boy, don’t you roam  
But my boots don’t fit by the hearth at home  
A restless soul just bound to stray  
Like a shadow lost at the break of day  

Oh the river runs but it don’t look back  
Through the hills and the dust and the railroad track  
I keep on walkin’, keep on prayin’  
But the good Lord knows I ain't stayin’  

So if you see me in some old town  
With a weary face and my head bowed down  
Just tip your brim, don’t ask me why  
A drifter’s heart ain't meant to lie  

Oh the river runs but it don’t look back  
Through the hills and the dust and the railroad track  
I keep on walkin’, keep on prayin’  
But the"
Lady Gaga,"Lights, lights, lights  
Let's go  

Lights, lights, lights, we shine in the dark  
Lights, lights, lights, electric in sparks  
Lights, lights, lights, we're burning like diamonds  
And lights, lights, lights, they follow behind us  

Oh, neon dreams in the midnight glow  
We don't stop, we lose control  
Turn it up, let the fever rise  
Dancing flames in the city skies  

We crash, we burn, we love, we learn  
Take my hand, feel the fire turn  
No regrets, no looking back  
We run till the morning cracks  

Lights, lights, lights, we shine in the dark  
Lights, lights, lights, electric in sparks  
Lights, lights, lights, we're burning like diamonds  
And lights, lights, lights, they follow behind us"
Lady Gaga,"(Verse 1)  
Diamond skies and neon dreams,  
Heartbeats race like movie scenes.  
Electric love, a velvet rush,  
Dangerous touch, but I need it too much.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
Oh, the night calls me by my name,  
Whispers fire in the pouring rain.  
No, I can’t stop, I won’t behave,  
I was born to misbehave.  

(Chorus)  
Burn it up, set the city on fire,  
Dancing wild like a live wire.  
No regrets, no looking back,  
We’re running fast on a heart attack.  

(Verse 2)  
Cigarette smoke and silver chains,  
Pour another shot to numb the pain.  
Velvet sins and leather cries,  
Love’s a game, and I roll the dice.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
Oh, the night calls me by my name,  
Whispers fire in the pouring rain.  
No, I can’t stop, I won’t behave,  
I was born to misbehave.  

(Chorus)  
Burn it up, set the city on fire,  
Dancing wild like a live wire.  
No regrets, no looking back,  
We’re running fast on a heart attack.

Oh-oh-oh, we shine too bright,  
Like diamonds cutting through the night.  
Oh-oh-oh, we kiss"
Lady Gaga,"Midnight leather, silver chain  
Neon dripping down the rain  
Ooh la la, don’t stop now  
Burning up this electric town  

Heartbeats thumping, strobe light high  
Glitter tears but I don’t cry  
Spin me ‘round, lose control  
Diamonds dancing in my soul  

Oh-oh, dangerous game  
You say my name, I go insane  
Oh-oh, fire ignite  
Love me wrong but hold me right  

Runaway fantasy, lips like a melody  
Boy, don’t you lie to me, I know you’re bad for me  
Velvet touch, poison rush, but I can’t get enough  
Oh, oh, oh—turn me to dust  

Leather kisses, lipstick sin  
Holy fever on my skin  
Dripping gold, take my hand  
Twist the knife and make it grand  

Oh-oh, dangerous game  
You say my name, I go insane  
Oh-oh, fire ignite  
Love me wrong but hold me right  

Runaway fantasy, lips like a melody  
Boy, don’t you lie to me, I know you’re bad for me

High heels clickin’ on the concrete scene  
Cherry lips, leather tight

Heartbeats runnin’, no more stallin’  
Oh-oh, fever’s risin’  
Burnin’ up, no compromisin’  

Take me higher, lost in motion  
Touch my skin, ignite the potion  
Velvet whispers, midnight thrill  
I want it louder, give me chills  

Drivin’ fast, don’t look back  
Love’s a game and I’m on the attack  
Black mascara, silver chain  
Diamonds fallin’ like electric rain  

Oh-oh, danger’s callin’  
Heartbeats runnin’, no more stallin’  
Oh-oh, fever’s risin’  
Burnin’ up, no compromisin’  

Take me higher, lost in motion  
Touch my skin, ignite the potion  
Velvet whispers, midnight thrill  
I want it louder, give me chills  

Spin me round, lose control  
Kiss me reckless, take my soul  
Thunder crashin’, hearts collide  
Baby, let’s get electrified"
Lady Gaga,"Velvet venom, silver skies  
Lipstick lightning in my eyes  
Neon whispers, sacred lies  
Dance until the echo dies  

Gold chains, heartbreaks, diamond tears  
Glitter burns but no one hears  
Fame is just a souvenir  
Kiss the night, erase the fear  

Oh-oh-oh, I'm electric in the dark  
Oh-oh-oh, set my body, strike a spark  
Love me reckless, love me raw  
Candle wax and meteor scars  

Plastic halos, holy sins  
Wrapped in leather, shed my skin  
Cinematic, fade to black  
Heaven’s calling, no way back  

Oh-oh-oh, I'm electric in the dark  
Oh-oh-oh, set my body, strike a spark  
Love me reckless, love me raw  
Candle wax and meteor scars  

Shadow kisses, static screams  
Crown of fire, built on dreams  
Say my name and pull me close  
One more touch before we ghost  

Oh-oh-oh, I'm electric in the dark  
Oh-oh-oh, set my body, strike a spark  
Love me reckless, love me raw  
Candle wax and meteor scars"
Kanye West,"Uh, woke up feelin’ like a king today  
Gold on my neck like a prince in play  
Told ‘em last year I was on my way  
Now the whole world wanna ride my wave  

They was sleepin’, now they wide awake  
Took the stairs up, never took no breaks  
I was dreamin’ bigger, had to raise the stakes  
Now my old teachers wanna say, ""Mistakes?""  

Nah, I ain't trippin', I been seein’ the vision  
Numbers goin’ up, now they callin’ it precision  
Did it independent, never needed no permission  
Whispers in the dark, turn to loud recognition  

I been too high, I been too fly  
I been too rare, I been that guy  
They been too scared, they been too shy  
Lookin’ at the throne like, ""Who? Oh my!""  

They ain't wanna see me get it, but I did  
Turned all my losses into lessons for the kid  
Now I’m writin’ checks, no more writin’ for the bid  
Told ‘em I was next, now they act like they forget  

I been too real, yeah, I been too cold  
Made my own way, I ain’t fit no mold  
Lookin’ at the city like, ""This my gold""  
I don’t need permission just to break that hold"
Kanye West,"Woke up feelin’ like a prophet in the land of frauds  
They sellin’ dreams but I been shoppin’ with the hands of God  
They want the chain, they want the fame, but what’s the cost of that?  
I built a kingdom out the pain, ain't no collapsin’ that  

They throwin' dirt but I just plant it, watch the garden grow  
They countin' pockets like accountants, but they pockets low  
I seen ‘em switch up for a dollar, seen ‘em break they code  
I kept it solid, now my heart feel like a pot of gold  

Hopped out the Matrix, never been basic  
They move in circles, I’m out here shapeshift  
Told ‘em I’m different, they didn’t listen  
Now they just watchin’ me move with precision  

Yeezy taught ‘em, but they never really learned the lesson  
Turned my losses into blessings, now my name a weapon  
Took the pain, took the stressin’, made it all aesthetic  
Now they watchin’, now they guessin’, but I been prophetic"
Kanye West,"Uh, woke up feelin’ like a king today  
Paparazzi flashin’, get up out my way  
Numbers goin’ up, check the stats, that’s a play  
They was sleepin’ on me, now they wide awake  

Took a couple L’s, now it’s back to the W’s  
Steppin’ out fresh, yeah, they copy how I move  
Talkin’ like they know me, boy, you barely knew  
I been on a mission, now I’m way above the view  

Floatin’, we coastin’, I’m way too high up  
They said I was done, now they switchin’ sides up  
Preachin’ like the pastor, got the choir lined up  
God flow, every time I drop, they rise up  

Ten toes down, I don’t trip, I don’t fall  
Made it through the fire, heard my name through the halls  
Legend in the makin’, tell 'em write it on the walls  
When I speak, it’s gospel, I ain’t worried ‘bout y’all"
Kanye West,"Yeah, I told ‘em take notes, this a real one  
Came up from the basement, now the ceilin’ gone  
I don’t do no favors, I just set the tone  
They was sleepin’ heavy, now they see the throne  

Late night schemin’, early morn’ flights  
Turn my L’s to lessons, now my name in lights  
You was talkin’ records, now you actin’ nice  
Funny how they love you when you doin’ right  

I been out in Tokyo, deals on the table  
Turned my life to movie scripts, yeah, this a fable  
Said I wouldn’t make it, now they check the label  
Numbers doin’ magic, haters turn to faithful  

I don’t play pretend, yeah, I keep it real  
Used to push the Honda, now the seats is teal  
Told my mama, “One day, we gon’ see a mill”  
Now we countin’ blessings with a gold refill  

They ain't see the vision, they was lookin’ blind  
Told me slow it down, but I just pressed rewind  
Take it to the max, yeah, this a different grind  
If you see me winnin’, know it's by design"
Kanye West,"Yeah yeah yeah, uh  
Too much on my mind, need a plane to escape  
Too much on my grind, got no time for a break  
I just pulled up in that matte black wraith  
They like ""Damn Ye, how you move like a saint?""  

I been in the lab like Dexter, no stressor  
Runnin' up the game, I ain't never need a lecture  
Diamonds on my chain, got 'em lookin' like a scepter  
They ain't see the vision, now they lookin' for a gesture  

Ay ay, Ye Ye  
They ain't see me comin', now they wanna ride the wave  
Ay ay, Ye Ye  
Took a couple losses but I never lost my faith  

Moonwalkin' through the lobby, feelin' like a new man  
Talkin' money, talkin' visions, I don't do no loose plans  
Told 'em I was different, they ain't listen, now they trippin'  
Now it's big flex, big checks, no permission  

God flow, God mode, yeah I'm really on that  
Every time I drop they react like it's combat  
Never sold my soul, yeah I kept it intact  
Had to move different, now the future lookin' matte  

Ay ay, Ye Ye  
They ain't see me comin', now they wanna ride the wave  
Ay ay, Ye Ye  
Took a couple losses but"
Prince,"Silk and diamonds on your skin  
Moonlight dancin', let me in  
Every whisper, every sigh  
Takes me higher, make me fly  

Candle flicker in your eyes  
Sets my body up in fire  
Touch me once and time stands still  
Like a dream that feels too real  

Oh baby, don’t stop now  
Ride this wave, I’ll show you how  
Drippin’ honey, taste so sweet  
Lose control between the sheets  

Velvet thunder, purple skies  
Fingers trace electrified  
Pull me closer, deep inside  
Tonight, my love, we’ll never hide  

Oh baby, don’t stop now  
Ride this wave, I’ll show you how  
Drippin’ honey, taste so sweet  
Lose control between the sheets"
Prince,"In the velvet night, where the diamonds glow  
She walks on fire, but you'll never know  
Lipstick lightning, a kiss so divine  
One taste of her love and you're lost in time  

Cherry moon drippin’ on her satin skin  
She whispers secrets where the dream begins  
Electric perfume in the air so sweet  
One spark from her touch and you’re off your feet  

Oh baby, don’t fight it, let it take control  
The rhythm of the universe deep in your soul  
She’s a fantasy, a fever, a sweet taboo  
And when the dawn breaks, you’ll be beggin’ for two  

Silk and shadows, neon rain  
Dancing reckless in love’s arcade  
No need for tomorrow, no fear of the past  
Just a moment in magic, a spell to outlast  

Oh baby, don’t fight it, let it take control  
The rhythm of the universe deep in your soul  
She’s a fantasy, a fever, a sweet taboo  
And when the dawn breaks, you’ll be beggin’ for two"
Prince,"Oh, sugar drippin’ in the neon light  
Got your eyes on fire, got your soul so tight  
Velvet moves in the midnight glow  
Come a little closer, let the fever grow  

Ooh, don’t stop, let it ride, let it roll  
Heartbeats tangled in the rock and the soul  
Cherry lips whisper what you wanna do  
Tell me all your secrets, I’ll give mine too  

Funk so dirty, make the heavens cry  
Love so wicked, make an angel lie  
Slip into the rhythm, let the world fall down  
Only thing that matters is the heat we found  

Oh, baby, can you feel that sound?  
Bass so heavy, gonna shake this town  
Drums keep bangin’, make your body sway  
We ain't stoppin’ till the break of day  

Come on, sugar, let’s ignite the flame  
Call my name, call my name  
Oh, baby, don’t you play no game  
Call my name, call my name"
Prince,"Ohhh darlin’ ohhh  
Night so deep, stars shine 4 U  
Every breath I take, it’s true  
I’m lost inside this velvet dream  
Wrapped in love, stitched at the seam  

I’d cross the fire, dance in the rain  
Anything 2 ease your pain  
If time stood still, I'd hold U tight  
Make U mine every single night  

Ohhh baby ohhh  
No one loves like I do  
A symphony plays when I’m with U  
If the sky should fall, I won’t run  
Your kiss is light, brighter than the sun  

When the world fades, when the beat slows  
I’m your rhythm, I’m your glow  
Take my hand, don’t be afraid  
Love’s forever, never fades  

Ohhh darlin’ ohhh  
Night so deep, stars shine 4 U  
Every breath I take, it’s true  
I’m lost inside this velvet dream  
Wrapped in love, stitched at the seam"
Prince,"Ooh, baby, velvet nights and electric rain  
You call my name, I feel the spark again  
Diamond silhouettes in the purple glow  
Every step you take, I lose control  

I can't fight it, no, I don't wanna try  
Your love's a fever and I'm burning alive  
Give me one more taste, just a drop of sin  
If loving you is wrong, let the night begin  

Oh, sugar, wrap me in your mystery  
Your touch is a secret written just for me  
Heartbeat thunder, got me on my knees  
Lightning in your kiss, set my soul free  

Dance with me, love, in the neon haze  
The world fades out when I see your face  
A symphony of whispers, bodies collide  
Lose ourselves in the heat tonight  

I can't fight it, no, I don't wanna try  
Your love's a fever and I'm burning alive  
Give me one more taste, just a drop of sin  
If loving you is wrong, let the night begin  

Oh, ooh wee, baby, take me higher  
Set my spirit in your fire  
No tomorrow, no yesterday  
Just you and me in the purple sway"
